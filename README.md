# WhatIfWorld

2021 Spring Semester Graduation Project

Brief Explanation : 
  Imagine guessing the affects of Covid-19 in different years with different starting countries..
  What would be the effect of smoking, wearing a mask and so much more.
  In this project we have gathered different datasets in order to create the ML models to predict the effects of these.
